Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 were launched in 1977 to take advantage of a rare
planetary alignment for gravity assists. Key facts:

- Launch: Voyager 2 on 20 Aug 1977; Voyager 1 on 5 Sep 1977.
- Grand Tour: Jupiter and Saturn flybys for both; Uranus and Neptune flybys by Voyager 2.
- Interstellar space: Voyager 1 crossed the heliopause in 2012; Voyager 2 in 2018.
- Golden Records: Phonograph records carrying sounds and images of Earth.
- Current status: Both continue to transmit data on the interstellar medium.

      content: `# HTTP/3 and QUIC Overview

HTTP/3 is the third major version of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol using QUIC.

- Transport: QUIC (UDP-based) replaces TCP to reduce head-of-line blocking.
- Standardization: RFC 9114 (HTTP/3) and RFCs 9000â€“9002 (QUIC) published in 2022.
- Benefits: Faster connection setup (0-RTT/1-RTT), multiplexing without TCP HoL blocking,
  improved congestion control and connection migration.
- Adoption: Supported by major browsers and CDNs; widely deployed on the public web.

CRISPR-Cas9 is a technology adapted from a bacterial immune system for editing DNA.

- Components: Guide RNA (gRNA) targets a DNA sequence; Cas9 is a nuclease that cuts DNA.
- Mechanism: Cas9 induces a double-strand break near a PAM site; cells repair via NHEJ or HDR.
- Applications: Research, model organisms, diagnostics; clinical applications are under active study.
- Milestones: First demonstrations in eukaryotic cells published in 2013.
